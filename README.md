This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to try and get three of their marks in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally - before the opponent does.
How to Play

Open the Game in a Web Browser:
The game should automatically open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can access it by typing the following URL in the address bar:

    Gameplay:
        Player 1 starts the game by clicking on any empty square on the grid.
        Alternate turns between Player 1 (who marks 'X') and Player 2 (who marks 'O').
        The game ends when a player successfully gets three of their marks in a row, or if all squares are filled without a winner (resulting in a draw).
