# Tic Tac Toe React App

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to try and get three of their marks in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally - before the opponent does.

### Installation ⚙️

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Aleksandar1105/tic-tac-toe-react-app`
2. Open in preferred IDE
3. Configure project
4. Start angular application with `npm run dev`

The game should automatically open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can access it by typing the following URL in the address bar:http://localhost:5173/

### Gameplay:

Player 1 starts the game by clicking on any empty square on the grid.
Alternate turns between Player 1 (who marks 'X') and Player 2 (who marks 'O').
The game ends when a player successfully gets three of their marks in a row, or if all squares are filled without a winner (resulting in a draw).
  
Restarting the Game:

To restart the game at any point, click the "Restart" button.
